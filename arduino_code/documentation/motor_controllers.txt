Angular Velocity: encoder ticks per second / encoder ticks per encoder revolution / gear ratio (8.3)* 2 pi 
- Read encoder ticks using interrupts/NOT digitalRead
- Interrupt on change from 0 to 1 and vice-versa  
- Use fastread function (Sparkfun)
 
Linear Velocity: angular velocity * radius of wheel

Linear velocity of Rockie = average linear velocity of each wheel  
Angular velocity of Rockie = difference in linear velocity of each wheel / (0.5 * distance between both wheels)

PD Controller for Rockie
------------------------
- Treating as continuous rotating servos:

int kp, kd;
while true {
	// PD Loop on either angular velocity or linear velocity
	
	
}

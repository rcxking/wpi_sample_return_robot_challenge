% Overview
\section*{Overview of design}

	This document contains a brief overview of our design goals as well as relevant descriptions of materials and preliminary design choices.  As this is our first year participating, we will be trying to keep our design straight forward.  ``\robotName" will be a four-wheeled mobile robot with 1-DOF mandibles.  Objects will all be stored in the hull, separated by cloth or plastic dividers.   An on board computer running ROS will control the autonomous sensing, roving, and object acquisition.   
%attached to a 3-DOF arm, bins for separating retrieved objects, multiple cameras, and autonomous controls built in ROS.

\subsection*{Hardware}

	% Communication protocols and frequencies used.
	The only communication we anticipate implementing is a wireless kill-switch.  For this, we will use an XBee PRO at 2.4 GHz, since it has excellent range and is easy to use.

	% Sensors for localization, navigation, obstacle avoidance, and sample id
	\robotName\text{ }will be equipped with at least two cameras: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item A high-definition color camera for long range perception, 
	\item A Kinect for point cloud data and SLAM refinement at medium range
	%\item A low-definition camera mounted near the gripper for use during grasping.
\end{itemize}
All cameras may contribute to object and sample identification.  

	Navigation, including localization and obstacle avoidance, will involve the very popular SLAM approach.  In particular, we will utilize the rgbdslam ROS package.

\subsection*{Safety features}

	% Wireless kill switch / on-board E-Stop

	% Hazardous materials compliance (battery?)



%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Software}

	We will use ROS as our software platform since it offers many useful libraries, in particular SLAM, SIFT, and PCL to name a few \todo{name some others that aren't vision related}.

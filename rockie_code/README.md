Installing Rosberry Pi
----------------------

[Here](http://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-and-ROS-Robotic-Operating-System/step2/Writing-the-image-to-the-SD-card/) is an instructable for installing ROS + Debian OS to the Raspberry Pi. Someone made an [image](http://www.zagrosrobotics.com/files/Raspbian-ROS-full.zip) of Debian with ROS fuerte pre-installed for the Raspberry Pi, so the installation is largely just writing this image to the SD card of the Raspberry Pi.
